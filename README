Statboard
=========

This was a project designed to provide a browser-side statistics dashboard for
my softball team. It was built with Foundation, IndexedDB and food.

The initial version was hacked together in less than 20 man hours (read: your
standard hackathon), half of which were spent deciphering IndexedDB. Thus, the
source code is extremely messy and undocumented. It is, however, functional.

Because this app runs entirely on the browser side, without any backend (other
than a primitive server for the files), it can be used offline. As a side
effect of the architecture of this dashboard, it also happens to abuse
IndexedDB's versioning system. In other words, this app is not to be used in a
professional setting without debugging tools, because it will break.

I hope you enjoyed this README. If you wish to torture yourself, I invite you
to read the source code. All others should most definitely stay away from this
project.
